This will force the notebook to restart and then run all code blocks below. If the menu is hidden, click the down arrow in the top right corner to make it visible again. If the 'Restart and run all' option is grayed out, it means you forgot Step 1. Click 'Yes' if it asks you if you are sure you want to do this. If it warns you that this notebook is not authored by Google, click 'Run anyway'. \n",
